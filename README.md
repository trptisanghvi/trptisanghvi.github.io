## My personal website 

“'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle."
Alice asks this question of herself in Chapter 2 of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, just after she has grown to a giant size. Alice realizes that she is not just trying to figure out Wonderland, but also attempting to determine who she is and what constitutes her identity in a world that actively challenges her perspective and sense of self.

This website is an attempt at self discovery. A collection of places, things, adjectives I would use to describe myself in the world. 

Just like me, the site is an ever evolving work in progress :)
